Scrollytelling takes many form but all work on the same 2 underlying principles:

1. Some **sticky** content
2. Binding **view state** to **scroll state**. Triggering view change when scroll reaches specific points in the UI.

We have created a reusable Vue component that simplify the creation of scrollytelling makes it intuitive so user can spend less time piecing together a functional scrolly and jump straight creating engaging scrolly content.

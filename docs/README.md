Scrollytelling takes many form but all work on the same 3 underlying principles:

1. A **sticky** background (or foreground)
2. Subscribing to **scroll events** and tracking the scroll position when user scrolls
3. Binding **view state** to scroll state and triggering view change when scroll reaches specific points in the UI.

We have created a reusable Vue component that simplify the creation of scrollytelling makes it intuitive so user can spend less time piecing together a functional scrolly and jump straight creating engaging scrolly content.
